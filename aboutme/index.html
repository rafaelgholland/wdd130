        <p>Hey, how's it going?</p>
        <p>Not to sound repetitive, but my name is Rafael Giacomelli Holland.
            I am a Brazilian currently working as a lawyer in my country.
        </p>
        
        <p>I do not have much previous experience in the area of Web Development,
            but in recent months I have developed (no pun intended) <br> a great interest in this segment.
            I see this applied technology course as an opportunity to open new doors in my career, in addition <br>
            to expanding my knowledge as a whole. I hope to learn a lot from you all.
            </p>
        <p>As far as hobbies go, I'm a lover of movies, series, anime, video games and any other art form that is able to entertains me. Besides <br>
            that I'm passionate about football (or soccer, if that's what you call it) and physical exercise. I'm not married, but I'm in a relationship<br>
            with the love of my life and I have plans to marry her in the future.</p>
        <p> This is my first course in the programming area so I look forward to discovering the millions of possibilities ahead. I would like to wish <br>
            you all good luck and let's make the most of it.</p>
