      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you love travelling? Try to imagine some of the last trips you've made. Being person whose passion for travel has led to various countries around the world, I'm sure at some point you felt lost, doing the same things, and what changed was just the scenery and the language. This is what I'm trying to help. I am a website developer, and my project seeks to unify information about localities in the main countries of the world and demonstrate how the trip can be even better enjoyed. My goal is to make travelers not only see the local culture, but how they are able to experience and live it, as it would be in a day-to-day scenario. Don't be in it, be it. How can I enrich your next trip?</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our main target audience is composed of people who are passionate about travel and have a desire to unveil the world in its most varied corners. Not only these, but we also seek to convey this passion to families or any people who has an interest in discovering more places that can be destinations for new adventures around the world and how to better enjoy them. In every case, we hope to positively influence the experience of each of our travelers with curiosities and indications of true connections to the local culture.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        <strong>First Proposition</strong> 
          - When thinking about enjoying a trip, the first thing that comes to mind is probably relaxation. After all, isn't relaxing what the holidays should do? But there's more than just letting go â€“ enjoying the sights, sounds and experiences of your destination should be a pleasant process from start to finish. Learn more about your next destination and how to make it memorable.

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Our Mindset</strong>
          - We are a young team passionate about new adventures, born from the desire to escape from common travel plans and non-remarkable experiences. It's not uncommon to feel trapped and uncomfortable with travel packages with linear schedules and experiences that just make us feel like a real mere visitor, someone who doesn't take advantage of the abundant culture that exudes even from streets in small towns or wonders in major world centers. As individuals, we have never been a fan of the idea of the same-old trip tour in which we experience the same things, just changing the environment, that being the locality or the people around us. For this reason, is that we give a great importance of treating each place with its due uniqueness, giving a great weight to the use of the natural or human wonders that only that locality can give us. Also, we must not forget the local culture, which in addition to providing us with a new perspective, can serve to impact us for the rest of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Travel or Adventure</strong>
          - Fact is that we do not consider ourselves a company in the field of travel, but of adventures. The change of term may seem subtle, but with this we want to give an assertion that we can and should give uniqueness to each of our experiences, venturing into what each country has to offer. Everyone has the right and duty to create new memories and experience incredible moments, regardless of being able to define in words or not. This is the way of thinking of this team and soon it can be yours too.

      <h3>Public Relation</h3>
       <p>
        <strong>Target Audience</strong>
         - There is not a close-minded target audience, because it is an idea that can be propagated and transmitted from person to person because of its liberating and curious character. On the other hand, it is plausible to conclude that this site will be a full dish for lovers of new adventures or who knows how to truly enjoy a place that has been on a previous occasion. Whether for the most assiduous travelers, with a passion for the unknown and what the world reserves for them, or for those who just want to upgrade on the next trip, whether it's business, vacation, or any other reason.  Anyone will have open doors to enter our site and search for locations they wish or will actually travel to. In this way, they will be presented with photos and information about the location, as well as suggestions for to-do that are beyond the travel plan of any travel company.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Interactions</strong>
         - Many similar ideas of websites do not carry the same responsibility and interest as we do, that we seek a true interaction with our audience and really gauge satisfaction with the content we are delivering. For this to be done clearly, you, visitor, will have an open channel to leave us discoveries about your latest experiences or even a negative comment about a certain locality that does not necessarily allow this natural and cultural interconnection. Whether through constructive or even destructive criticism, we will always strive to improve our content to better suit the user experience that visits our site.
