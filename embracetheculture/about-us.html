            <h2 id="mind-msg">Our Mindset</h2>
            <p>We are a young team passionate about new adventures, born from the desire to escape from common travel plans and non-remarkable experiences. It's not uncommon to feel trapped and uncomfortable with travel packages with linear schedules and experiences that just make us feel like a real mere visitor, someone who doesn't take advantage of the abundant culture that exudes even from streets in small towns or wonders in major world centers. As individuals, we have never been a fan of the idea of the same-old trip tour in which we experience the same things, just changing the environment, that being the locality or the people around us. For this reason, is that we give a great importance of treating each place with its due uniqueness, giving a great weight to the use of the natural or human wonders that only that locality can give us. Also, we must not forget the local culture, which in addition to providing us with a new perspective, can serve to impact us for the rest of life.</p>
            <h2 id="ta-msg">Travel or Adventure?</h2>
            <p>Fact is that we do not consider ourselves a company in the business of travel, but of adventures. The change of term may seem subtle, but with this we want to give an assertion that we can and should give uniqueness to each of our experiences, venturing into what each country has to offer. Everyone has the right and duty to create new memories and experience incredible moments, regardless of being able to define in words or not. This is the way of thinking of this team and soon it can be yours too.</p>
